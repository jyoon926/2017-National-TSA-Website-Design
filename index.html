  <h3 class="wow fadeIn">Privatizing Space Exploration</h3>

  <p class="wow fadeIn">
    In the past and today, there have been and are many ongoing searches for ways to explore our solar system or privatization of space exploration. On October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched the first ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into space. On July 20, 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong took "a giant step for mankind" as he stepped onto the moon. Six Apollo missions were made to explore the moon between 1969 and 1972. On November 13, 1971, the Mariner 9 probe became the first craft to orbit another world, Mars. By the end of the 1970s, the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and their moons. Six years later the probe Viking 2 discovered martian frost on the Martian surface. There are many ways to explore the solar system, these are just a few ways the world has privatized space.
