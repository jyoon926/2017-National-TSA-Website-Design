  <p class="wow fadeIn">
    There have been and are many ongoing searches for ways to explore our solar system and learn more about the whole universe. On October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched the first ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into space. On July 20, 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong took "a giant step for mankind" as he stepped onto the moon. Six Apollo missions were made to explore the moon between 1969 and 1972. On November 13, 1971, the Mariner 9 probe became the first craft to orbit another world, Mars. By the end of the 1970s, the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and their moons. Six years later the probe Viking 2 discovered martian frost on the Martian surface. There are many ways to explore the solar system, and these are just a few ways the world has privatized space.

      The Evolution of Space Vehicles
    </h2>

    <p class="wow fadeIn">Space vehicles first started with the mathematical demonstration about how to achieve liftoff using liquid fuels. This was eventually achieved when Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket on March 16, 1926. Later on nearing the end of World War II, Germany launched ballistic missiles respectively known as the A4 and the V-2. The space age then started when Satellite Sputnik became the first satellite to be launched into space on October 4, 1957.

      Manned Spacecrafts
    </h2>

    <p class="wow fadeIn">
      The Vostok Program is responsible for starting the production of manned spacecrafts. Mercury was the first manned spacecraft made by the United States. Apollo spacecrafts became the first to be able to reach the moon. The Space Shuttle was developed to build Space Stations such as the ISS. China developed the Shenzhou spacecraft, and it became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capabilities. NASA is currently developing a spacecraft capable of going to Mars, as well as other private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. The current manned programs are: Soyuz Program, Shenzhou Program, ISS, and Tiangong-2.

  <h3 class="sectiontitle wow fadeIn">Pros and Cons of Manned Missions to Mars
</h3>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>
    Like the bold journey of Christopher Columbus to the unknown worlds of North America, NASA is set to go on a 21 month manned mission to the surface of Mars by 2030. With this in mind, there are two sides that people seem to align with when discussing a manned mission to another planet like Mars.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  
  <p>
    One side believes that by sending humans to Mars, we are completing yet another huge technological feat while gaining a valuable understanding of life. One of the greatest reasons why these people think this, is because there is a chance that astronomers will discover new forms of life on Mars. There have been many instances where scientists have gotten evidence for possible signs of life. The most obvious are the discovery of ice water, and a conceivable chance of there being liquid water. Water is the best way of looking for life because it is a precursor for it to exist. NASA astronaut Rex Walheim said, "There have been a lot of clues we've seen that there is potentially life on Mars, but the only way to find out is to really go there,"" and he is totally true. There is no way of knowing. Also, Mars has several elements that could be harvested and utilized to expand and support human exploration of Mars and beyond. We could essentially harvest raw materials, construct space vehicles, and launch to other planetary bodies from the surface of Mars without wasting time and resources here on Earth. For example, methane, which is a very common material on Mars, could be used to build plastic based structures. Third, Mars could be a safety planet just in case we destroy this one. Humans have caused many global problems here on Earth, that might prevent us from being able to survive. Global warming, pollution, destruction of wildlife/habitat, overpopulation, and countless more issues, may eventually force us to either die out or move the location to another world. Finally, this mission could be a stepping stone for exploring the universe. Ever since the Apollo missions to the moon in the min-1900s, there hasn't been any revolutionary events or advancements in terms of space exploration. For NASA to be relevant to the needs of society, they must constantly be making advancements that amaze the average citizen. Nobody wants to see that the pinnacle of NASA's capability won't be able to go further than our own moon. After all, who else is going to inspire the future generations of engineers to dream the unimaginable. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
  <p>
    However, there are many downsides that the human race must consider. This side believes that a manned mission is the opposite of what we should do because it will be a challenge that is too hard to take on. Probably the most important reason why we should avoid a mission like this is because it will be too dangerous. It anything bad happens along the way, it would take no less than six months to send a team to rescue the long dead astronauts. Also, there are negative effects in staying in space for that long. Space radiation and microgravity. Space radiation can often cause cancer, cataract formation, and even death. Although scientists are developing materials to diminish incoming radiation and utilize a combination of radioprotectors to limit the effects of ionizing radiation, the level of radiation will sometimes be too high to safely protect an astronaut. Microgravity, on the other hand, can cause muscles to shrink bones to weaken. To cancel out the effects of microgravity, a rigid exercise routine and proper nutrient intake are necessary. Without them, microgravity will most likely have very negative effects on you. Another downside is that the mission will be too costly. Estimates say that it will cost more than 20 million dollars, and that money could go towards a better cause such as fighting the rising national debt, infrastructure, education, and other immediately useful projects. Third, and finally, there are more significant problems here on Earth. Why try to conquer another planet, if we cannot even control one? Things like poverty, war, global warming, and pollution are problems that we should be investing most of our time on. We should be focusing on fixing our home planet than invest in another.
</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>In a nutshell, we don't really have an answer to the question of whether we should invest our resources in a manned mission to Mars or not. There are so many things we need to consider, before settling on a final decision. But back to Christopher Columbus. He, along with his brave crew, embarked on a journey that many thought was impossible. He risked everything that he had including his life so that he can discover the New World. Should we trust our luck and skills and do what Columbus did, or should we not risk it, and instead solve major problems on our home planet, Earth? We will have to wait and find out.
