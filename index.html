  <p class="wow fadeInRight">
    There have been and are many ongoing searches for ways to explore our solar system and learn more about the whole universe. On October 4, 1957, the Soviets launched the first ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into space. On July 20, 1969, Astronaut Neil Armstrong took "a giant step for mankind" as he stepped onto the moon. Six Apollo missions were made to explore the moon between 1969 and 1972. On November 13, 1971, the Mariner 9 probe became the first craft to orbit another world, Mars. By the end of the 1970s, the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and their moons. Six years later the probe Viking 2 discovered martian frost on the Martian surface. There are many ways to explore the solar system, and these are just a few ways the world has privatized space.

      The Evolution of Space Vehicles
    </h2>

    <p class="wow fadeInRight">Space vehicles first started with the mathematical demonstration about how to achieve liftoff using liquid fuels. This was eventually achieved when Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket on March 16, 1926. Later on nearing the end of World War II, Germany launched ballistic missiles respectively known as the A4 and the V-2. The space age then started when Satellite Sputnik became the first satellite to be launched into space on October 4, 1957.

      Manned Spacecrafts
    </h2>

    <p class="wow fadeInRight">
      The Vostok Program is responsible for starting the production of manned spacecrafts. Mercury was the first manned spacecraft made by the United States. Apollo spacecrafts became the first to be able to reach the moon. The Space Shuttle was developed to build Space Stations such as the ISS. China developed the Shenzhou spacecraft, and it became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capabilities. NASA is currently developing a spacecraft capable of going to Mars, as well as other private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. The current manned programs are: Soyuz Program, Shenzhou Program, ISS, and Tiangong-2.

      Unmanned Spacecrafts
    </h2>

    <p class="wow fadeIn">
      Most of the unmanned spacecrafts are either satellites or space probes, which are used to study and record different information. However, NASA has launched other unmanned vehicles such as the Mars rovers.

  <h3 class="sectiontitle wow fadeIn">Pros and Cons of Manned Missions to Mars</h3>
  
  <h2 class="wow fadeInDown">
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p class="wow fadeInUp">
  	There is a lot of controversy on whether NASA or any other private spaceflight company should invest money and resources on colonizing Mars. There are many advantages, but disadvantages also have to be considered. Should the human race trust our luck and test our skills to embark on a mission of this scale, or should we not risk it, for there are so many things that could go wrong?</p>
  
  <section>
    <div>
    <h2 class="wow fadeInLeft">
  Pros</h2>
    
    <p class="wow fadeInLeft">First of all, on the positive side, there is a chance that we could discover new forms of microscopic life on Mars. Especially since there is a possibility that there is flowing water on Mars, the chances are quite high. Another advantage is that it could be a stepping stone for exploring the galaxy. Finding out that the pinnacle of the human race's capability will stop at Earth's orbit would be sad. Also, being able to colonize Mars would inspire the future generations of engineers.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2 class="wow fadeInRight">
  Cons
    </h2>
    <p class="wow fadeInRight">
  On the other hand, there are disadvantages that make this decision a lot harder. The biggest reason why we shouldn't invest in another planet, is that there are more significant problems here on Earth. Poverty, global warming, the mass extinction of non-human species, war, gun laws, racism, sexism, a low quality and unequal public educational system, pollution, and destruction of wildlife/habitats are just a fraction of the problems that human race faces. We should be focusing on fixing our home planet rather than invest in another.
